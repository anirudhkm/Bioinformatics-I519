Our analysis began with reads data (output of sequencing machine, generated in a previous study). We did not include this data, since they are fairly large files.

The data.csv file contains the output of the edgeR normalization (input for normalization was the HTSeq output).

The "HTSeq output" directory contains the read counts for each sample (generated with htseq).

Italy-, North_carloina-, and Western_Australia.csv contain the data from the data.csv file, for samples of the respective provenance.

Please read the Report-I519.pdf for detailed explanation of the project.
